 <summary><h3>üó∫Ô∏èüñ•Ô∏è Jolycky's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  Once upon a time in elementary school, I stumbled upon the vast realm of technology while exploring the wonders of the internet on my dad's computer. My initial fascination led me to dip my toes into blogging, igniting a spark that would later evolve into a fiery passion for all things tech. The pivotal moment in my coding journey happened when my phone decided to take an unexpected plunge into the world of malfunctions. Instead of surrendering it to the mercy of a service center, I opted to embark on a mission to fix it myself. It was a bold move, driven by the belief that the challenge was worth the reward. Little did I know, this hands-on experience would mark the beginning of my journey as a digital problem solver.

 
Fast forward to senior high school, where I took my passion to the next level by joining a computer student organization. This decision catapulted me into a leadership role, providing me with the opportunity to guide and inspire others on their tech journeys. The experience not only honed my technical skills but also nurtured my ability to lead and collaborate in the dynamic world of technology.

As I transitioned to college and delved into the world of information systems in the computer science faculty, my hunger for knowledge only intensified. Fueling this fire, I took on the role of co-leading a community known as the Google Developer Student Club at UPNVJT. This community became a playground for ideas, a breeding ground for innovation, and a haven for collaboration. Through each chapter of my coding odyssey, from elementary school exploration to high school leadership and college community building, I've learned that the true essence of technology lies not just in the code but in the impact it can make. My journey is a testament to the belief that every challenge is an opportunity, and every line of code has the potential to shape the digital future. And so, the adventure continues, with each keystroke paving the way for a new and exciting chapter in my coding saga.
